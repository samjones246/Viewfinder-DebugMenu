# Installation

 - Download the [latest release](/../../releases/latest/download/Viewfinder-DebugMenu.dll) of this mod and place it in `<Steam Library>\common\Viewfinder_Demo\Mods`
 
# Usage
 - `F1` - Toggle debug menu
 - `F2` - Toggle debug overlay
 - `F3` - Toggle Fly (must have opened the debug menu at least once)
 - `F6` - Toggle level select menu
 - `End` - Instantly use teleporter to next level (*note: The teleporter must exist in the scene, e.g. the photo containing it must be placed*).
 
 ## Level Select Menu
 The level select menu is accessed via the "New Level Management" option. When selecting a level in the list, a number of variants will be shown to the right of the main list. Only the **last variant in the list** for each level is actually present in the demo, and attempting to load any of the others will crash the game.
 The menu can be closed by pressing Escape.
